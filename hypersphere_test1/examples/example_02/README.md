#Equipartiton of vectors on a symmetric hypersphere / second example

This repository contains code for generating equidistributed vectors on a symmetric hypersphere. The code implements algorithms to evenly distribute vectors across the surface of an n-dimensional hypersphere, ensuring symmetry and uniformity in their distribution.

#execute

In this exemple, there are 3 atoms in 3 dimensions, and 1 vector to equidistribute with 2 fixed vectors (along x and z axes for each atom).
As there is 3 atoms leaving in a 3 dimensional space, the dimension in which the vectors are equidistributed is a 9-dimensional space.
You can modify the parameters in 'run_example_02.sh'.

To execute it, write in the terminal :

./run_example_02.sh
