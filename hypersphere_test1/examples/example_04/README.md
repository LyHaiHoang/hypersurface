#Equipartiton of vectors on a symmetric hypersphere / fourth example

This repository contains code for generating equidistributed vectors on a symmetric hypersphere. The code implements algorithms to evenly distribute vectors across the surface of an n-dimensional hypersphere, ensuring symmetry and uniformity in their distribution.

#execute

In this second example of the use of symetries, there is 1 atom in 3 dimensions, and 10 vector to equidistribute with 1 fixed vector (along z axe).
At the end, we have 22 vectors, because of the reflexion matrix.
You can modify the parameters in 'run_example_04.sh'.

To execute it, write in the terminal :

./run_example_04.sh
