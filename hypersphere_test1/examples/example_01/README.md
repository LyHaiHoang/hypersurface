#Equipartiton of vectors on a symmetric hypersphere / first example

This repository contains code for generating equidistributed vectors on a symmetric hypersphere. The code implements algorithms to evenly distribute vectors across the surface of an n-dimensional hypersphere, ensuring symmetry and uniformity in their distribution.

#execute

In this exemple, there is only 1 atom in 2 dimension, and 20 vectors to equidistribute with no permutation matrix or fixed vectors.
You can modify the 3 parameters in 'run_example_01.sh'

To execute it, write in the terminal :

./run_example_01.sh
