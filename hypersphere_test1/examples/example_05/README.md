#Equipartiton of vectors on a symmetric hypersphere / fifth example

This repository contains code for generating equidistributed vectors on a symmetric hypersphere. The code implements algorithms to evenly distribute vectors across the surface of an n-dimensional hypersphere, ensuring symmetry and uniformity in their distribution.

#execute

In this exemple, there is 1 atom in 3 dimensions, and from 2 to 200 vectors to equidistribute.
The 'results.dat' shows the average minimal distance squared between each vectors, depending on the number of vectors.
You can modify the parameters in 'run_example_05.sh'.

To execute it, write in the terminal :

./run_example_05.sh
