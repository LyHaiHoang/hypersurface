#Equipartiton of vectors on a symmetric hypersphere / third example

This repository contains code for generating equidistributed vectors on a symmetric hypersphere. The code implements algorithms to evenly distribute vectors across the surface of an n-dimensional hypersphere, ensuring symmetry and uniformity in their distribution.

#execute

This exemple is the heptamer island example : there are 7 atoms in 3 dimensions, and 2 vectors to equidistribute with 1 fixed vector.
We use 5 matrix to take the symetries into account.
As there is 7 atoms leaving in a 3 dimensional space, the dimension in which the vectors are equidistributed is a 21-dimensional space.
You can modify the parameters in 'run_example_03.sh'.

To execute it, write in the terminal :

./run_example_03.sh
