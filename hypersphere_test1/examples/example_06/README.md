#Equipartiton of vectors on a symmetric hypersphere / last example

This repository contains code for generating equidistributed vectors on a symmetric hypersphere. The code implements algorithms to evenly distribute vectors across the surface of an n-dimensional hypersphere, ensuring symmetry and uniformity in their distribution.

#execute

In this exemple, there is 1 atom, leaving from a 2 to a 20-dimensional space, and 25 vectors to equidistribute.
The 'results.dat' shows the average minimal distance squared between each vectors, depending on dimension where vectors are equidistributed.
You can modify the parameters in 'run_example_06.sh'.

To execute it, write in the terminal :

./run_example_06.sh
